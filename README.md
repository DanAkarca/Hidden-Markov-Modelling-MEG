# Hidden Markov Modelling of MEG data at rest and task
This code was used for my MPhil in Neuroscience @ MRC CBU, for the thesis titled "Characterising the neurophysiological signature of a mutation in ZDHHC9". 

This ultimately became for the basis for the published paper:
Functional network dynamics in a neurodevelopmental disorder of known genetic origin. Hum Brain Mapp. 2020 Feb 1;41(2):530-544. doi: 10.1002/hbm.24820. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639257
